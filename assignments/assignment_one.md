## Introduction

You may have heard the cliche "What is important is not the destination, but the journey".  In analytics it's often the process of analysis, and discovery that gives us our biggest insights.  The process of collecting data, processing it and performing statistical analysis on the data can also cause significant artifacts that can skew our results.

Because the process can be so significant this assignment challenges you to record your process.  This course requires the use of three key pieces of open access software.

1.  PostgreSQL
2.  pgAdmin (or similar)
3.  R
4.  RStudio (or similar)

In Assignment One (due **Sept 5**) you will install these programs and record the following for each:
