# Final Exam

## Lecture 1

* What is ACID?  Explain each element of ACID with respect to some issue.
* Given some major data management concerns (Duplication, Security, Incomplete records, Parallel Transactions), how does ACID address these issues?
* How do databases differ from things like CSV files, or Excel for data management?

## Lecture 2

* Explain a database server, a database, a schema, a table, a tuple and a column.
* With a database diagram such as the one for Instagram (lecture 2), explain the key relations and purpose of the database.

## Lecture 3

* What elements are needed to connect to a database/database server?
* Given a `CREATE TABLE` script, explain what the table is, and what it might be for.
* Explain `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, `ORDER BY` and elements of a simple `SELECT` statement.

## Lecture 4
* Normalization
  - Expect to see unnormalized tables & normalize them.
  - First, Second & Third normal forms
  - Explain why certain solutions (e.g., hobby_1, hobby_2, hobby_3 columns) are inappropriate.
* Given a table, break it into normal form & explain choices

## Lecture 5
* JOINs
  - Likely with Lecture 4 data
  - Show the results of `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` and `FULL OUTER JOIN`s

## Lecture 6

* Aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM` and `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* Some debugging R (what would this return? Why does this cause an error?)
* What tables need to be joined to produce a certain table or result?  E.g, Given a taxi schema, how do we get average driver rating by pickup neighborhood?

## Lecture 7

* `INDEX`es: Simple definitions, purpose

## Lecture 8

*  Analysis of data.  Given some data questions and plots, explain what the pattern is, does it support the question?  Are there data artifacts?
* Structure of a project folder (also in earlier lectures)
* Why do we use a `db_connect.txt` file?
* Are sample datasets appropriate to answer a certain question?

## Lecture 9

* Data formats, JSON, CSV, JSON-LD, YAML
  - Linked data
  - Strengths

## Lecture 10

* Big data and analytics
  - Four "V"s of big data
-
